              <p>After high school, I studied computer science at UBC.</p>
              <p>
                &lt;üëµüèº&gt; Back in my day, we wrote code on paper! With pencils!

              <p>
                I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life. I took some time
                away from school to work full-time. During this period, I worked
                retail, hospitality, legal, and even spent some time as a pastry
                cook!
              </p>
              <p>It was fun. It was exhausting. It was... life.</p>
              <p>
                I felt like something was still missing. I knew I wanted to go
                back to school.

              <p>
                I was laid off when the pandemic hit. I took this opportunity to
                finish my degree, majoring in something I had always been
                passionate about - psychology.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, after some time passed... I found myself missing
                coding.

                In 2022, in the last year of my UBC undergraduate degree, I
                signed up for the Lighthouse Labs flex program!
              </p>
              <p>
                It was definitely difficult to balance the two programs, but I
                knew I could rise to the challenge.

                I'm an artist, and love all things art & design (especially when
                they're edible). I'm dedicated to creating beautiful things in
                all that I do - illustration, ceramics, textile arts, pastry...
                and even code!
              </p>
              <p>
                I have an absolutely crippling fear of heights... but learned to
                snowboard two seasons ago and love it! ...When I'm done
                hyperventilating, that is...
